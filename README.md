## Description

The Tech Blog project is a CMS-style blogging site designed for developers to publish their blog posts and engage in discussions through commenting on other developersâ€™ posts. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm and uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Users can create an account, log in, create and edit blog posts, leave comments on posts, and delete comments or posts. The application also features automatic logout for inactive users.

## Code

I want to highlight this code because it demonstrates the use of Handlebars.js in creating a form for users to create a new blog post. Handlebars is a templating engine that allows you to create dynamic HTML templates with embedded JavaScript.In this code, we see that the form is created using HTML and has two fields: a title and a content field. The form also has a submit button that triggers the createBlogPost function in the createBlogPost.js script file.What's interesting about this code is that Handlebars is used to dynamically render the values for the name attributes of the input and textarea fields. This allows the server to access the values submitted by the user using the same name that is defined in the model schema, making it easier to handle form submissions.

```JavaScript
<form class="create-blogpost-form">
  <h2>Create a New Blog Post</h2>
  <label for="blogpost-title">Title:</label>
  <input type="text" id="blogpost-title" name="blogpost_title" required>
  <label for="blogpost-content">Content:</label>
  <textarea id="blogpost-content" name="blogpost_content" required></textarea>
  <button id="create-blogpost" type="submit">Create Blog Post</button>
</form>
<script src="/js/createBlogPost.js"></script>


```
